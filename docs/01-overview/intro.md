Heighliner is a modern app development platform.
It aims to help developers to build apps easily and quickly using the state-of-the-art cloud native stacks.
Use Heighliner to spin up the development environment.
Then you can focus on writing the business code without worrying build and deploy.
The code doesn't even need to exist on your local machine -- All you need is an IDE to develop.

## Why Heighliner

- **Smart platform**:
    Heighliner sets up the development environment which fits your apps automatically.
    It optimizes the build and deploy process, collects the logs and traces, provides app-centric monitoring dashboards,
    enhances security and access control, etc.
    It provides the cloud native best practices out of the box for your apps.
- **Seamless workflow**:
    Without Heighliner, we have seen people install and use various tools (e.g. Elastic, Argocd, Grafana, API Gateway) on Kubernetes.
    It fragments their development time and makes them painful to connect the tools to the apps.
    With Heighliner, you can focus on your business code while enjoying the seamless workflow, integrated with open source cloud native tools.
    You can see and manage the logs, metrics, CI/CD pipelines, security access, image scannning results on Heighliner.
    All of these are provided automatically while you work on writing the app.
- **Declarative Setup**:
    Traditional tools 
- **No vendor lock-in**:
