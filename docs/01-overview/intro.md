Heighliner is a modern app development platform.
It aims to help developers to build apps easily and quickly using the state-of-the-art cloud native stacks.
Use Heighliner to spin up the development environment.
Then you can focus on writing the business code without worrying build and deploy.
The code doesn't even need to exist on your local machine -- All you need is an IDE to develop.

## Why Heighliner

- **Smart platform**:
    Heighliner sets up the development environment which fits your apps intelligently.
    It configures the infrastructure stacks to optimize for your apps, e.g. Helm chart, container builds, app-centric monitoring dashboards, security and access control, etc.
    You can enjoy the cloud native best practices out of the box.
- **Seamless workflow**:
    Without Heighliner, we have seen people install and use various tools (e.g. Argocd, Grafana, Nocalhost, API Gateway) on Kubernetes.
    It fragments their development time and makes them painful to connect the tools to the apps.
    With Heighliner, you can focus on your business code while enjoying the seamless workflow, integrated with open source cloud native tools.
    You can see and manage the logs, metrics, CI/CD pipelines, image scannning results on a single platform.
    All of these are provided automatically while you work on writing the app.
- **Declarative setup**:
    Traditional tools ask you how to achieve the operations.
    This doesn't work at scale. People get confused and lost with too many complex details.
    Heighliner as a modern tool asks you what to achieve.
    You define the end goals and Heighliner will make it to the end.
    You can enjoy the simplicity of declarative APIs while Heighliner handles the low-level complex details.
- **No vendor lock-in**:
    Heighliner is open source, vendor neutral, platform agnostic.
    With a multi-cloud, pluggable architecture, Heighliner can adapt your apps to all major clouds.
    Your code remains the same while Heighliner does the heavy lifting.
    You can run it on any cloud, even on your in-house ones.
    It is truly build once and run anywhere.
